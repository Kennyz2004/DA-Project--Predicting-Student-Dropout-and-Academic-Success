# - What is the business problem? 
Qualification for scholarships in universities has to undergo criteria for the applicants that are committed to finishing their education and be considered an ideal investment to provide financial aid to education. The problem looks to understand factors that can cause students to drop out of a university and impact their academic outcomes.  The study in particular understands predictive factors that link to a student's dropout or completion by understanding what factors (course, mother/father occupation, displaced, age, gender, etc) interact with each other. With this research, it can safely predict the student dropout rate to improve the rate of student retention.

# - What is the business goal? 
This is significant to many universities, especially school administrators for scholarships, as they provide countless scholarship programs that depend on financial eligibility and academic performance. As scholarship programs are not given to every student who applies, we need to learn and predict students' backgrounds to effectively consider when looking out for higher-education scholarships. Scholarships are also considered to be an investment in a person's educational attainment, and if it can be predicted that a student could drop out from the program, discernment on their scholarship package can be adjusted.

# ML  used?:  
Given the supervised & structured nature of the dataset—that is, containing more than two class labels (i.e., “Graduate,” “Dropout,” and “Enrolled”)—multi-class classification should be used by the machine learning project to predict. Under this type of machine, we will be doing regression to predict the continuous value for our labels.
